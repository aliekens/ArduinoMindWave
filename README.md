# ArduinoMindWave

This Arduino example program allows you to connect to a NeuroSky MindWave EEG brain sensor, using a BlueSMiRF bluetooth module. The program prints eSense "attention" and "meditation" values over the Arduino's Serial monitor.

Make sure to connect RX and TX pins of the BlueSMiRF to pins 5 and 6 when running this sample.
